# Tensor Transport Protocol (TTP)
## A minimalist yet exstensible protocol for transporting tensors.

The goal of TTP is to create a standard minimum that enables basic conversion between protocols.

### Per Transport
* Target (recepient and computation)
* Map of Alias' and Tensors (alias -> tensor)
* Metadata Map (name -> byte array)
### Per Tensor
* Data Type (data type for the given tensor)
* Tensor Dimensions (dimensionality of the given tensor)
* Tensor Contents (raw bytes using C-standard for packing a multidim array)

## Generate Protobuffers

If you haven't already, download and install the [protobuf compiler](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases) (protoc). Add the binary to your path. 

To simplify the process of generating protobuffers, included is a useful generator script. This script depends on a 3rd party fork of Google's protoc-gen code which improves the quality of code generated by the protoc tool. Install with the following command and then run generate in the repo root.

```bash
# generate necessary code files
go get -u github.com/gogo/protobuf/protoc-gen-gogofaster
go generate ./...
```

## JSON Support
Protocol Buffers automatically map to JSON and vice versa. Examples of standard and extended JSON tensors, requests, and responses are on the way!
